Comparator is an interface that is used to define how a collection must be sorted.
In Java 7, it had just 2 methods â€“ compare() and equals().
The enhanced Comparator in Java 8 now has 19 methods.
However, the Comparator is still a functional interface as it has only one abstract method, i.e., compare().
Comparator now supports declarations via lambda expressions as it is a Functional Interface.
