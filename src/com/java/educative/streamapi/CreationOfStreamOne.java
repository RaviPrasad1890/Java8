/*
A few important points about streams are:

A stream is not a data structure itself.
It is a bunch of operations applied to a source.
The source can be collections, arrays or I/O channels.

Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure.

There can be zero or more intermediate operations that transform a stream into another stream.

Each intermediate operation is lazily executed (This will be discussed later).

Terminal operations produce the result of the stream.
