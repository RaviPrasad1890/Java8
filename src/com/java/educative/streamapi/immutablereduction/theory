Reduction stream operations are those operations that reduce the stream into a single value.
The operations that we are going to discuss in this lesson are immutable operations because they
reduce the result into a single-valued immutable variable.
Given a collection of objects, we may need to get the sum of all the elements,
the max element, or any other operation which gives us a single value as a result.
This can be achieved through reduction operations.

Before we discuss all the reduction operations in detail, let’s first look at some key concepts of reduction:

Identity – an element that is the initial value of the reduction operation
and the default result if the stream is empty.

Accumulator – a function that takes two parameters: a partial result of the reduction operation
and the next element of the stream.

Combiner – a function used to combine the partial result of the reduction operation when
the reduction is parallelized or there’s a mismatch between the types of the accumulator
arguments and the types of the accumulator implementation.
